This branch is used for the Wii No Ma Panel Music Playing POC.

# room-server
You'll most likely want to [create a virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install things. For example:
```
python3 -m venv virtualenv
```
Ensure you active the environment.

From there, install requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# Useful for reading .flaskenv.
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

You'll then need to install PostgreSQL. Copy `config-example.py` to `config.py` and update this config.

Finally, run in development mode.
```
flask run
```

How to create the base music playing panel that this will be based on:

# myMPD

myMPD is a standalone and lightweight web-based MPD client. It's tuned for minimal resource usage and requires only very few dependencies. Therefore myMPD is ideal for raspberry pis and similar devices.

The backend ist written in C and has no dependencies to external databases or webservers. The configuration is stored in plain text files and all the data is pulled on demand from MPD. The MPD database is the only source of truth for myMPD.

The frontend is mobile friendly, written as a PWA and offers on all devices the same functionality. It communicates over AJAX and websockets using the json-rpc 2 protocol.

myMPD also integrates extended features like an advanced jukebox mode, timers, triggers and smart playlists. With the integrated lua interpreter myMPD functions can also be scripted.

## Dependencies

myMPD has no hard dependencies beside the standard c libraries. Not installing the optional dependencies leads only to a smaller subset of myMPD functions.

- OpenSSL >= 1.1.0 (optional): for https support
- libid3tag (optional): to extract embedded albumart
- libflac (optional): to extract embedded albumart
- liblua >= 5.3.0 (optional): for scripting myMPD

## Build Dependencies

- cmake >= 3.4
- libasan3: for debug builds only
- Java: to minify files (optional)
- Perl: to create translation files

## Quick Build Instructions

1. Get myMPD tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/jcorporation/myMPD/releases/latest)
2. Extract myMPD tarball and change path to this directory
3. Install dependencies (as root): `./build.sh installdeps`
4. Build myMPD: `./build.sh release`
5. Install myMPD (as root): `./build.sh install`

## Run

Adapt the configuration file `/etc/mympd.conf` to your needs (`/etc/webapps/mympd/mympd.conf` for Archlinux) or use the [mympd-config](https://github.com/jcorporation/myMPD/wiki/mympd-config) tool to generate automatically a valid `mympd.conf`.

``
Usage: ./mympd [/etc/mympd.conf]
``

The `./build.sh` script installs a startup script for systemd, openrc or sysVinit.
